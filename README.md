## About
<p>
This depthmap includes all elevation data from NASA's website like mountains and ocean beds with a custom alpha map to articulate Earth's land surfaces.<br>
The map is ideal for 3d printing because unlike a regular Earth depthmap, this map articulates countries that have almost the same geological depth as the tectonic plate they are on, for example England.
